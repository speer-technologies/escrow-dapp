## Summary

The goal of this test is to make you code a small Escrow DApp (decentralized app) using Solidity and Web3.js.

### The app should have these functionalities
- A Buyer and a Seller confirm and agree on the terms of a sale of a Seller's product. The Buyer places Ethereum currency into the smart contract - this provides buyer's proof-offunds to the seller.
- The Seller sees that the buyer has enough funds and ships the product to the Buyer producing an evidence of shipment to an independent third party called Escrow Agent.
- Escrow Agent sees the evidence of shipment and initiates the transfer of the funds stored in the escrow to the Seller. The transaction is now complete.
- In case the seller does not produce an evidence of shipment to the Escrow Agent then Escrow Agent returns the funds from escrow to the Buyer. Buyer receives his/her money back.
- Escrow Agent can get a small fee of the transaction amount for his/her impartial arbitration.

### Rubrics
Show us what you can do in 48 hours. You will be assessed on the following parameters: 
- Functionality covered
- Efficiency of your Smart contract
- Code Readability and Maintainability

### Bonus points if you
- Deploy the smart contract to an Ethereum Testnet
- Create an accompanying browser interface (can be barebones - no styling required) to interact with the smart contract (send, receive tokens) by connecting your Metamask or any other wallet

### Submission
Required:

- **[Remix Playground](https://remix.ethereum.org/)** (make sure it's public) with your code 
- A link to your deployed smart contract on **Etherscan**.

For Bonus section:

- A deployment link to your web interface (if applicable) where our recruiters can interact with the live version. You can use freely available tools like **Remix, Metamask, etc** to deploy your Smart contract.
- If you don't know how to create an interface for your smart contract, you can refer **[Scaffold-Eth](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth)**'s documentation.
- You can also find examples of other DApps in there for inspiration!

You should email the links to our recruiters with the subject line **Blockchain Developer Assessment - [Your Name]**

**Note:** Submissions without the **required** links will be removed from any further consideration.

#### All the Best!
